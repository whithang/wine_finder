== README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* New Apps (supress test suite so that you can add rspec & and use pg for heroku)
   `rails new [name_the_app] -T --database=postgresql`


Please feel free to use a different markup language if you do not plan to run
<tt>rake doc:app</tt>.
